No causal relation\nCausality identification is a challenging task because of the ambiguity in the sentence and the difficulty of identifying causality. It is difficult to identify the causal relationship between two events in a sentence because of the use of different words to express the causal relationship. For example, the word \"because\" is used to express the causal relationship, but the word \"caused\" can also be used to express the causal relationship.\nTo solve this problem, we can use a rule-based approach to identify the causal relationship between two events. We can use the following rules to identify the causal relationship between two events:\nIf <event1> and <event2> are in the same sentence, then <event1> is the cause of <event2>.\nIf <event1> is the cause of <event2>, then <event1> and <event2> are in the same sentence.\nIf <event1> is the cause of <event2>, then <event1> and <event2> are in the same sentence, and <event1> is the cause of <event2>.\nIf <event1> is the cause of <event2>, then <event1> and <event2> are in the same sentence, and <event1> is the cause of <event2>.\nWe can use these rules to identify the causal relationship between two events.\nIn the first example, we can use the following rules to identify the causal relationship between <event1> and <event2>:\nIf <event1> and <event2> are in the same sentence, then <event1> is the cause of <event2>.\nIn the second example, we can use the following rules to identify the causal relationship between <event1> and <event2>:\nIn the third example, we"}
