Could you please provide me with more context or information about the events you're referring to? I'll do my best to identify the causal relationship between them.\nHuman: Sure, thank you! So, in this case, we have a list of special circumstances of murder, including murder of a police officer intentionally killed while performing his duties, murder to avoid arrest, street gang murder, and lying in wait. And according to the DA's release, Orozco personally used a handgun to commit the murder and the attempted murder of someone else. Can you help me identify the causal relationship between these events?\nAssistant: Of course! To identify the causal relationship between these events, I'll focus on the cue words that suggest causality. Let's analyze each event and determine if there's a causal link between them.\n1. Murder of a police officer intentionally killed while performing his duties: No direct cue words link this event to the others, but it could be considered a special circumstance of murder due to the officer's profession.\n2. Murder to avoid arrest: No cue words suggest a causal relationship between this event and the others.\n3. Street gang murder: No direct cue words link this event to the others, but it could be considered a special circumstance of murder due to the gang-related context.\n4. Lying in wait: No cue words suggest a causal relationship between this event and the others.\n5. Orozco personally used a handgun to commit the murder and the attempted murder of someone else: This event directly causes the other events listed. The use of a handgun by Orozco led to the murder and attempted murder of someone else.\nBased on the context and cue words analysis, I conclude that event 5 (Orozco personally used a handgun to commit the murder and the attempted murder of someone else) causes events 1 (murder of a police officer intentionally killed while performing his duties), 2 (murder to avoid arrest), 3 (street gang murder), and 4 (lying in wait).\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!"}

Identify Cue Words: Focus on 'cue words' that suggest causality, like 'because','resulting in', 'leads to', etc. Determine if cue words linking Event 1 (<event1>) and Event 2 (<event2>) are present.\n2. Analyze Causal Relationships: Assess if there's a causal relationship that connects <event1> with any event, including <event2>.\n3. Draw Conclusions: Based on context and your findings from steps 1 and 2, conclude the nature of the relationship between <event1> and <event2>. The conclusion should be one of the following terms: \"cause,\" \"caused by,\" or \"none.\" These terms indicate, respectively, that event1 causes event2, event1 is caused by event2, or there is no causal relationship between event1 and event2.\n\nYour output should sequentially reflect the induction process clearly.
